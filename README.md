# F1 Championship Simulator
During a party last year, my friend wondered what percentage of a chance Lewis Hamilton had in winnning the 2021 F1 World Championship, so I made a calculator to calculate all possible scenarios between Max and Lewis.

Therefore, with 4 races to go after the Mexican GP, I wrote this code in Java (a language I was learning at the time) and the results may suprise you!
